# Kuppy

**Kuppy** is a minimal JavaScript library for building interactive cup brackets (e.g. 8-player single elimination). It works with plain HTML and lets you programmatically or interactively move players through the rounds.

Originally built in 2013. Cleaned up in 2025.

### Why I built it

Back in 2013, I was building a multiplayer online learning game as part of my university studies. The game featured a knockout tournament where students competed in a math challenge. Each match consisted of two players going head-to-head. Both were shown five questions â€” things like `1 Ã— 5`, `6 Ã— 3`, or `2 Ã— 6` â€” and the player who answered more correctly (or faster) won the match.

The winner advanced to the next round. The loser was eliminated but could join a new tournament. It was like *Battlefield*, but with mathematics!

I needed a way to render the tournament bracket, but there were no good open-source libraries at the time. So I built my own. That library eventually became Kuppy.

### âœ¨ Features
